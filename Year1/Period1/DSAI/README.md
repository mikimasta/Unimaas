# Introduction to Data Science & AI
-----------------------------------

## **Lecture 1** (5.09.2022, Pietro)

> #### *_Sciences are primarily defined by their questions, not by their tools!_*

### What is Data Science?
- Sexiest job of the 21st century!
- Why is that?
	- More and more data is being generated
	- There is a growing demand to make sense and understand those data
- Statistics
- Math
- Critical thinking
- **_Asking questions!_**

> Data Science is the discipline that describes, predicts, and makes causal inferences, based on data.
> Data Science is the process of extracting knowledge or insights from data (structured or unstructured)
>> **Data** -> **Information** -> **Knowledge**

> #### *The value of data is in the impact they have on desision making!*

### What is Artificial Intelligence?
-> Field of study which studies how to create computers and software that are capable of *_intelligent_* behaviour.

### Why.
As a data scientist the best question you can ask yourself is **why**. -> *_Start with the questions, not the data!_*
	- Why has this data been gathered?
	- Why am i seeing this?
	- Why is it visualised like this?
	- Why do i see (or not see) patterns?
	- What does this data represent?
	- How can i make use of it?
---------------------------------
### The Data Science Process
1. **ASK** an interesting question.
	- What is the scientific *goal*?
	- What would you do with all the *data*?
	- What do you want to *predict* or *estimate*?
1. **GET** the data.
	- How were the data *sampled*?
	- Which data are *relevent*?
	- Are there *privacy* issues?
1. **EXPLORE** the data.
	- *Plot* the data.
	- Are there *anomalies*?
	- Are there *patterns*?
1. **MODEL** the data.
	- *Build* a model.
	- *Fit* the model.
	- *Validate* the model.
1. **COMMUNICATE** and **VISUALIZE** the results.
	- What did we *learn*?
	- Do the results make *sense*?
	- *_Can we tell a story?_*

### first, **DATA**
- raw facts
- recorded symbols
- unprocessed information (either structured or unstructured)
### then, **INFORMATION**
- data in context
- data with meaning, relevance
- refinement of data for the context of human use
### at last, **KNOWLEDGE**
- result of understanding information
- information with direction or intent - it facilitates a decision or an action
- *_Information put into action!_*
--------------
### As a data scientist, your success is dependent on:
> 1. Asking (yourself) the **right questions**
> 1. Your ability to find the **right data** to collect.
